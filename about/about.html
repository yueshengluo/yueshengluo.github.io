        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class = "center">
        <p> Origami has always been a friend to me as I grow up. I think it’s time I should write a few word about it.</p>
        <p> I was obsessed with origami since I was only a six years old. I can still remember the first origami book my dad bought me. With his help, together, we finished all the paper works in that book. Since then, I received more and more origami books as gifts or prizes from my parents, and I worked everyday to fold all the papers. Sometimes I would even refuse to have dinner until I had finished folding. I enjoyed the process of folding them; the challenges it brought to me from each of those origami and completing them with a sense of achievement. That’s why I never used colored paper, and all of my products ended up in a large paper bag, never taken out until some guests came and my mother starts showing off how talented I was. </p>
        <P> It drove me crazy when I was in primary school. I spent a lot of my free time folding, even cutting my certificates into square pieces when I run out of papers. However my childhood origami stopped gradually as I moved on to higher grades and started to get endless homework from the pedantic Chinese education system. The origamis were also no longer challenging for me. Origami was a huge part of my life and study, one that helped me to fostered a spirit of never giving up and finishing a job at once. Later I noticed that I had a distinctive sense of dimension, geometry and especially 3D, not to mention that I was always the first to finish my art project in class and the best among my classmates. My friends gave me the nickname “the king of origami”, which sounds very childish now, but I was very proud of that title.
          </P>
        <P> If it all ended like that, origami would have been one of my most unforgettable memories from childhood, and may be only a memory. However there were much more stories for me and my beloved origami. Time went on as I grew up. At age 16, I went into an international high school, where there was not much Chinese standardized test education, and I had more free time to spend on my hobbies. That’s when my high school origami story begins. 
          </P>
        <P> I remember it was a very coincident night (maybe it wasn’t). I was looking through my RenRen(Chinese version of Twitter). Just as I was about to close the page, I happened to saw a album of origami instructions of a fictional jet fighter. It was something I had never seen before. It had so many steps and each step was so complicated with my friend’s retweet quote “finishing that would take me for a whole life time”. At first, I was astonished, and suddenly a brave idea submerged: why don’t I take a try, this is the challenge I’ve been looking for. So immediately I grabbed a piece of newspaper, and started to fold according to the instructions. After nearly an hour I finished it. I have to say it was really hard, some steps were so sophisticated that would took me a long time to work out even if I were to fold it right now. However, it didn’t take me a whole life. But certainly it changed my perspective toward origami. Origami is no longer a children game for babies, it can be so elaborate like a piece of art. And then I started to look up this models on the internet, and found that they are the Modern Origami. Everything they fold looks so vivid, like a fine art sculpture. The origami project I used to make were like cartoon toys compared with them. Looking at all those art masterpieces, another great thought came into my mind: I will finish all the origami I can on this website. Starting from today, one for every week. Then, I took on this challenge.
          </P>
        <P> Following months were the time I made my biggest progress in origami. I even started inventing a few of my own origami. I select my origami instructions on weekdays and fold them on weekends. I always believe that the selecting is worth a time, insomuch that ever since I decided, it would be the one that will take me a few hours to complete, so it must be a “most wanted” one. And on every Fridays, as soon as a return from my dorm, I would start my work. Oh wait, first I had to wash my hand(which I usually don’t do), dry them and adjust the light and… Get everything well prepared before the sacred folding began. After the ablution it would be the night of origami sometimes even the morning of origami on Saturday. </P>
      <P> I found that the process of folding those papers is so fascinating. The most intrinsic and hardest part is that you have to transform the plain instruction diagram into a three dimensional structure in your mind, and apply the step on the paper holding in your hand, and then you will surprisingly find that the shape of that paper have completely transformed over the last step. It changed into the shape exactly the same with the structure you imagined in your mind, only it was real and you could feel it with your hands. Sometime it would take a pile of steps just to fold the assist lines for one super intricate step. And sometime even if you are already an expert in origami you might still have chance to fail in doing some simplest steps, because folding an origami has a lot to do with aspiration and luck. You may work on a single step till midnight and still can’t figure it out, but the next day when you get up just a single glance will solve this magic trick. Every step you finish will bring you a strong joy of achievement especially those that takes you decades of minutes to finish. The harder it is the more joy you get from it. It is that sense of achievement that impels you to do another one and after with another, until all the steps start to linger around in your mind, like different flavors floating in the finest restaurant in France. And when they combine, the new creations comes out. Just get a piece of paper and fold it into any shapes you want. Enjoy yourself in the wonderful paper land.
