                            where origami folders can share instructions, finished works and stories. The site
                            currently has over 15 thousand registered members and 190 thousand posts and is separated

                            related to a model in general.
                        </p>
                        <p>Leisure:
                            This section is for discussion none related to origami. The contents are very random that
                            vary from football matches to personality test.
                        </p>
                        <p>Download:
                            Download is the major section of Origami Academy. It offers a vast amount of instructions
                            in many forms. From here you can find video tutorial, picture instructions, diagrams,
                            crease patterns. In each segment instructions are sorted into categories of different types
                            like, animal, vehicle, plants, characters and so on.
                        </p>
                        <p>Service:
                            Service section is where the managers of the site will post notice and guides.
                        </p>
                        <p>This site particular important to me. It is where I started with my origami passion and
                            where I get most of my instructions from. Personally I haven’t contributed to the site with
                            my own instructions nor have I participated in the discussions, but I received lots of
                            help, looking through others’ posts. The site is very well-built, with its purpose to serve
                            the need of folders to communicate with each other and to get resources for folding. It has
                            grown very mature in the past 7 years that I used this site. The section are easy to
                            navigate and most importantly as an origami website, it is easy to find the instruction you
                            want, due to its great classification and strict post naming rules.
                        </p>
                        <p>The biggest problem about this site is the copyright issue. As a commonly neglected problem
                            in China, copyright ignoration makes this site a violation to the origami artist who
                            created the models. As a origami creator myself, I understand the time and effort put into
                            creating a model and not to mention the effort to publishing a origami book. However, in
                            Origami Academy, there are countless instructions from photo shoots of published origami
                            books. Moreover, the sharing of these resources are not free. Although almost costless,
                            people are transacting for instructions with virtual currencies in the forum and none of
                            the profit goes to the actual author. I only used the original created content after I came
                            to the US and realized the importance of copyright. It is definitely a issue that this site
                            needs to improve.
